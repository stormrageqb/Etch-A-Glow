# Etch-A-Glow

This is a browser art pad inspired by the mechanical drawing toy, Etch A Sketch. I named it "Etch-A-Glow" because users can use glowing squares to sketch their designs.

## Description

A fun and often therapeutic application where users can generate, save, and print awesome designs of their own using custom grids, gap, colors, and special glows. In the same vein as the original Etch A Sketch, users must begin and develop their artwork from the perimeter of the grid, or from previously filled-in grid cells.

## Functionality

Upon loading the application, users are presented with a sidebar displaying the various creative options and a blank canvas. Each set of options in the sidebar are divided by functionality.

### Sidebar Options:

The first set of options controls the grid size and the gap. Users input a number between 1 and 100 to generate various grids. For example, if the user inputs 16, they will generate a 16x16 grid with a total of 256 cells.
Users can also manipulate the grid gap (space between cells) on a scale between 0 (no gap) and 5 (5 pixels worth of gap);

Below the grid sizing options, users will discover the color palette. Here they can change both the cell color and the grid gap color using color pickers. Users may also check the box labeled "Rainbow" to randomly generate different colors for every grid cell crossed.

The next set of options deals with adding glow to individual cells. Both inner glow and outer glow are manipulating using the color picker. Setting the inner glow color will change the color of the inside of the perimeter of the cell. Likewise, setting the outer glow color will change the color of the outside perimeter of the cell. Users can be quite creative with these settings and achieve some interesting overall effects when used in tandem with the color palette. I felt it would limit the user if they were stuck with inner or outer glow upon selecting those options, so I also added the option to disable all glow effects. Using the checkbox, users have the option to turn off and turn on their glow between, for example, creation using the color palette.

Finally, the last set of options consist of two buttons. The first button allows users to save their work as a PDF, so that they can share it with their family or friends. This also doubles as a means to print a finished design if desired. The second button is a simple way for users to reset their grid and start anew.

### Sketching Your Glow:

After inputting a grid X/Y count, users can already begin creating their design using the color pallete's default colors. Users simply drag their mouse cursor across the grid cells to leave a trail of color. From here, users can try experimenting with other colors and glow settings along with changes to grid size and gap to find a suitable base canvas.

## Additional Features:

It would be interesting to add different shapes, for example, a grid of circles or triangles instead of rectangles or squares for more customizability. Implementing a system where users could manipulate how much glow is added to each cell would also bring out some fun designs.
